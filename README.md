# Al-Powered Linux Assistant Fine-Tune Project (“Red”)

This project is designed to fine-tune a model to function as a command-line interface (CLI) assistant named **“Red”**. Red is an AI-powered Linux assistant capable of performing system tasks, executing terminal commands, and providing contextual guidance in real-time.

## Features

* Modular AI assistant architecture for Linux automation.
* Executes terminal commands safely and efficiently.
* Provides context-aware guidance using natural language understanding.
* Supports command routing, follow-up instructions, and tool recommendations.
* Compatible with multiple Linux distributions and configurable for different OS environments.

```

### Dataset

The `advance_train.json` dataset contains an array of command objects. Each object includes:

* `instruction`: The command or query that the user might provide.
* `response`: The expected assistant output or guidance.
* `mission_tag`: Categorization of the command for routing purposes.
* `context`: Relevant system or situational context for the command.
* `tools`: Tools or utilities required to execute the command.
* `os_compatibility`: Supported operating systems.
* `follow_up`: Optional suggestions or follow-up actions for the user.

### Source Code

* **`train.py`**: Handles the fine-tuning of the model using the dataset. Supports custom configurations for batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.

### Configuration

* **`finetune_config.yaml`**: Defines hyperparameters, model architecture options, and training preferences. Adjust to customize the fine-tuning process.

### Dependencies

Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset (`data/LINUX_DATASET.jsonl`) with all necessary commands and context.
2. Adjust the fine-tuning parameters in `configs/finetune_config.yaml` as needed.
3. Run the training script:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

4. After training, deploy the model to your server or local environment. Red will be able to respond to Linux CLI commands in real-time.

## Quick Start Example

After deployment, you can interact with Red like a real terminal assistant:

```bash
$ red
Red CLI Assistant v1.0
Type 'help' for commands or 'exit' to quit.

> check disk usage
Red: Checking disk usage...
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1       50G   20G   28G  42% /

> update system
Red: Running system update...
All packages are up to date.

> create user "alice"
Red: Creating new user 'alice'...
User 'alice' successfully created.

> help
Red: You can ask me to:
- Check system resources
- Manage users
- Install or update packages
- Monitor running processes
- And much more...
```

This demonstrates how Red interprets commands, executes them safely, and provides helpful output.

## Deployment

* Manual server setup and SSL configuration for secure deployment.
* Designed for robust Linux environments with minimal downtime.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! You can:

* Add more command-response pairs to improve Red’s capabilities.
* Optimize model performance for faster response times.
* Integrate additional tools or system utilities.

Submit a pull request with your proposed changes, and include test cases or examples to ensure proper functionality.
